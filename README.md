# XMLObject

This is the source for  an ASP project I was working on in 2001â€”2005,
called **XMLObject**, which is still available at [https://xmlobject.greystate.dk][URL]

It's an ASP (JScript) Object Wrapper for a number of actions, necessary when
working with XML and XSLT in an ASP environment.

## Status

The code is only here for posterity reasons - It's still being used in a few
other legacy projects of mine, but I'm not actively developing this anymore.

Feel free to poke around though :)
